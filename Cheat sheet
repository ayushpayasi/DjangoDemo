to create a python project on django-
django-admin startproject project name

to run server-
python manage.py runserver

python data flows in following pattern after a server is created:
1) the request is made through the browser.

2) the url is first checked for the same link(if url is written in the urls segment  then step 3)
for example :
  a sample url path looks like:
    
    urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('',"appname.python-file-name(generally views).function name(in views)"),
    ]

3) it goes to the created views file looks for the function that is to be called.
  
  a view file looks like : 
    def home(request):
      return render(request,'login/home.html')
4) after this the page with the name home.html is searched in the directories where the pages are to be stored.
It can be always changed in the dirs of settings just by adding the name of the folder in the list
